The goal of this thesis is numerical comparison between the process of nucleation in the Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model and the predictions of classical nucleation theory (CNT). My contributions towards this goal include:
\begin{itemize}
\item The implementation of code to obtain the nucleation rate and incubation time in the PFC model.
\item The implementation of code to examine the wave mode amplitudes in nuclei during the early stages of nucleation in the PFC model.
\item The implementation of code to approximate the form of the critical nuclei in the PFC model.
\item Deriving equations for the variation of nucleation rate and incubation time following the assumptions of CNT.
\item Applying the implemented code to test the agreement between nucleation in the PFC model and the predictions of CNT.
\end{itemize}
